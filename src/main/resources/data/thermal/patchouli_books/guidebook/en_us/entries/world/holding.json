For every level, it increases capacity by 50%, up to +200% at Holding IV (3x). This stacks with other things that modify storage capacity, such as $(l:thermal:technology/augments/introduction)Augments$(/l). For example, if a machine has $(l:thermal:technology/augments/integral_components)Resonant Integral Components$(/l) and Holding IV, the RF storage will be multiplied by 12x."    }  ]}
